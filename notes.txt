     * Ok, the problem is that two sites that are close may independantly find a best set that when set together causes them to overlap. This can happen
     * when just looking at protein overlaps, as the sfat atom on the NLN is moving around. It's worse when you consider glycan overlaps.
     * When searching for the best overlaps, the monte_carlo function must always treat new low/equal overlaps as better. If it found zero for a site,
     * overlaps are reintroduced by another site moving, then when it finds a new zero for this site, the new one should take precedence. Going to check
     * that now.

During protein overlaps resolution, if I set best chi values at the end then delete any with overlaps, I may delete sites that now overlap with each others sfat atoms, which may turn out ot be resolvable. Especially if both sites have alternative zero overlaps positions. So, how about look at records and any that have found a solution that is within the tolerance get kept, rather than setting chi values, recalculating overlaps and deleting. Yes let's do that now.
In DeleteSitesWithOverlaps, I'll only look at the records?
